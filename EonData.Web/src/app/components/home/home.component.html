    <p>Hi, I'm Mike, a software developer based in Perth, Western Australia since 2010. Originally from Austin, Texas, I've embraced the sunny beach lifestyle and am now the proud father of three amazing kids. When I'm not unwinding with a video game, I enjoy experimenting with new technologies like AI/ML and home automation/IoT &mdash; anything that lets me play with code.</p>
    <p>With over a decade of professional software development experience, my passion for computers and programming goes back to my childhood. My expertise lies in data integration and back-end solutions, but I'm also well-versed in full-stack development, system administration, and platform maintenance.</p>
    <p>This website is built using an Angular frontend and an ASP.NET Core API, hosted on Amazon Web Services (AWS). I've employed various AWS services such as CloudFormation, CloudFront, EC2, S3, and DynamoDB. Many of the images were created with Stable Diffusion or similar techniques. My main goal is to utilize this site for system automation and showcasing data-related projects I'm working on.<!-- You can explore my more experimental work at <a href="https://www.eondream.com/">EonDream</a>--></p>
